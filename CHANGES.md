 * Change shortcut for __“Alternate File”__ from <kbd>⌃⇧↓</kbd> to <kbd>⌃⌥⇧↓</kbd>. You can get back the old shortcut by opening the bundle editor (“Bundles → Edit Bundles”), navigating to “RSpec → Menu Actions → Alternate File” and setting “Key Equivalent” accordingly. See [#57](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-tmbundle/issues/57) for the reason of this change.
